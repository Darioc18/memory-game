# Testing

In order to confirm the correct functionality:

- Testing has been conducted on multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, ensuring that the website appears and functions as intended in each of them.
- The responsive design has been tested using the developer tools option, ensuring that the website dynamically adjusts and adapts across various screen sizes (the style.css file contains multiple media queries, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.).

  | 1   | My aim was to initiate the timer when the user clicked on the first card, so I inserted the `function timer()` within the `function flipCard()`. However, I noticed that the timer malfunctioned, accelerating each time I clicked on every other card.                                             | I found a solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68211977/how-to-invoke-a-function-on-only-the-first-click). By creating a boolean variable and implementing a check within the timer function, the issue was fixed, ensuring the timer worked properly |
  | 2   | I encountered a bug related to background images. I chose to include the background images through CSS instead of HTML, as I planned to update the image for specific media queries. However, I faced some issues in controlling the size and position of the background images using `object-fit`. | I used `background-size`, which specifically manages background elements in CSS. Unlike `object-fit`, which applies only to HTML `<img>` elements.                                                                                                                                |
  | 3   | Clicking on the last two matching cards triggered the win screen to appear before the card flipping animation was completed.                                                                                                                                                                        | To resolve this issue, I implemented a solution using the `setTimeout` global function. By introducing a delay, I ensured that the win pop-up screen would only appear after the card flipping animation had finished.                                                            |
